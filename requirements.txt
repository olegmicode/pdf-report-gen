We are looking for a Python developer with experience with reportlab to create PDF documents in Python.  The document we are looking to create is a VICS Bill of Lading to be used for shipping.  We have a sample program that we started to create but we are struggling with getting the table data in frames to flow to the 2nd page.  With one frame, it works fine.  But, with 2 frames it is not working.  In the PDF, the Customer Order Information is fixed on the 1st page but should flow to the 2nd page if there are more than 4 entries.  The Carrier Information is also fixed on the  first page and should flow to the 2nd page if more than 5 entries.  The attached PDF shows an example of page 1 and page 2.  The input data for the PDF is a json file.
